We got inspired to create a smart fridge that can automatically log in what's inside the fridge, enable users to access the data remotely and have information recommended for the users based on what they have in the fridge.","This is an IoT-based smart fridge that uses Computer Vision to automatically log in food, informs the users through text messages of what's stored inside and expiration data, and recommend healthier and better use of user's’ current storage through features like checking nutrition and search for recipes related to some items.","We used a button on an Arduino board to emulate the action of “closing the fridge door”. The signal created by the button is sent to a PC through a serial COM port. When PC receives that signal, the kinect camera is triggered to capture a photo of the current status in the fridge. The photo is then compressed and sent to our web server. Our web server is coded on Python+Flask and deployed on Google App Engine Flexible Environment. This web server also contains some logics for responding to Twilio messages, which will be mentioned later. When the web server receives that photo, it puts the photo in Google Cloud Storage. It also keeps some basic image metadata in Google Cloud Datastore database. Then the Google Cloud Vision API is called to analyze the photo and label it by what the item is and which category it belongs to. The labels (coming out of cloud vision api) are then passed to Google KnowledgeGraph API to be further narrowed down to things people would normally put in a fridge. The results coming out of Google KnowledgeGraph are then stored in Google Cloud Datastore database. Now the fridge basically identifies the items that were put in it by automatically capturing and analyzing photos. Every time new items are added to the fridge, Twilio would send a notification through SMS to inform user Users are also able to text Twilio some basic commands to:",California Institute of Technology,03/05/2017,True,False,True,True,True,False

He knew there had to be a better way to purchase simple goods. It's 2016 for god-sakes!","PepperPay makes checking out of your favorite store easier. It starts at the store, by being asked if you need any help with your store visit. It then allows you to buy the goods you've picked out, without having to deal with a cashier. All you have to do is hold up each item in front of the camera. It will then use image recognition (courtesy of IBM Watson) to figure out which item it is. It will then match that against a database to let you know the price. Without even taking out your wallet, you can then press a button to log into PayPal and pay. This process reduces the average checkout time by over 50%. Built with love by Team Croissant.","We started by designing a simple flow for checking out different items. We then built a customized web page for the tablet display on the Pepper robot (courtesy of SoftBank). After learning the different gesture and other functionality using Choregraphe, we decided to go with the JavaScript wrapper for the Python API. This enabled us to quickly iterate on different robot control ideas. While that was being worked on, Adam tapped into the Watson Image Recognition API for taking the pictures from Pepper and converting them to specific items that we could put a price on.

What resonated with us is the low investigation rate. Most of the cases are not looked at because of the lack of evidence which we thought is the first step to achieving justice. We want to minimize actions required by victims as much as possible which lead us to a smartphone application that can automate violence detection, gather evidence, and request for help.","Autochime is a convenient way to automatically record evidence for sexual or physical assaults. In its initial state, it will look for certain predefined, and later trained, patterns which are associated with incidents of abovementioned type. Once its matches shaky movements and high volume sounds or specific user-customized keywords, it will trigger an alarm which simultaneously starts a recording procedure. This will be sent together with a GPS location to trusted parties, such as friends or family, via SMS. The message also includes a direction to a website where a log of incidents is journaled, upon which they decide to notify authorities or not. The recordings can be later used to take legal action, identify the offender, and bring him/her to justice. This disrupting approach is supposed to encourage women to report as they have credible evidence to rely upon. Furthermore, it may stop violation on spot or even avoid the assault to be happened, as the awareness of the app among potential offenders may raise the anxiety to be caught.","We begun by putting all of our ideas on the table. Some teammates suggested connecting friends with victims, some suggested integrating with Facebook, and some suggested using the phone’s sensors. We pooled our ideas together and AutoChime was born. Only two of us have Android experience so it was a great learning experience for all of us.
